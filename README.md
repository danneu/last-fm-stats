# last-fm-stats

Collects and displays last.fm users with the most compatible taste in music for a given username.

Eventually I want to provide similar statistics not readily accessible from last.fm's interface.

It's also an excuse to mash together Compojure, Hiccup, Garden, and Redis.

## Prerequisites

* [Leiningen][1]
* Redis for caching API hits.
